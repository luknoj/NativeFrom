## Getting Started

First step is to install all dependencies in project directory with:

```
npm install
```

Next you can run the app in project directory with:
for Android
```
react-native run-android
```
or for iOS
```
react-native run-ios
```

To run test you can use:

```
npm test
```

Or if you want to run separate test:
```
npm test COMPONENT_NAME
```
